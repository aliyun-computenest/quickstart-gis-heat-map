Overview A Heat Map Tile is a data visualization tool that represents the spatial distribution of data by overlaying colored tiles on a map. Each tile's color intensity reflects the magnitude or concentration of a particular metric within that area. Heat Map Tiles are often used to visualize geographic data, making it easier to identify patterns, trends, and outliers at a glance.
